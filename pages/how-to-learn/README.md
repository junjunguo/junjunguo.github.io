# sections

## thinking

- focused mode
    - learning
    - practice
    - homework
    - problem solving
- diffuse mode
    - generate new ideas
    - being creative
    - understand at concept level

## memory

- working memory
    - short term
    - easy to lose
- long term memory
    - need to repeat
    - gone if not use

## chunk

- chunk
    - things we learned saved as chunk
- chunking
    - connect chunks
    - smaller chunk when we understand
    - connect chunks differently to solve problem, create new understanding, or ideas

## consistent

- learn things little at a time
- learning is the same as gaining muscle, it would not happen overnight, we train, eat, sleep, and muscle grow bigger over time.
- fit our level
- same as workout, lift too heavy may physically hurt us, right technique, lift weight that we can handle.
- it is important to have positive feedback to gain motivation to continue.
- Lifting a little heavier to challenge ourselves can lead our muscles to grow bigger and quicker.
- by deliberate practice we can also gain better results.  

## sleep

- recover
- solving problems while sleeping
- make a next day plan before sleep
- try to solve problems or try to learn difficult things before sleep

## focus time

- 25 minutes concentration time
- music can help concentrate
- little rewards after each focused work: social media, tv, te, chocolate ...

## training 

- grow our brain
- health for our body
- a good way of interleaving your learning or problem solving
- get a diffuse thinking
- get out of something (study, problem need to solve) that may block you


tips: 

#  physical exercise

- We once fault thought that all of the neurons in the brain won't grow as adults.
- but we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day, 
- one of these places is very important for learning new things.
- new neurons help us learn new things, but they will die if we do not use them. 
- new experiences will rescue them.
- physical exercises also help the nervous to survive.
- exercise is by far better than any drugs on the markets.
- exercise benefits all of our other organisms.

tips: 

- create a lively visual metaphor or analogy 
    - to remember and understand concepts.
    - to see something in your mind's eye.
    - helpful in not only in art and literature
    - but also allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.
    - help being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.

- practice
    - deliberate practice 
    - on the toughest aspects of the material 
    - can help lift average brains into the realm of those with natural gifts.
    - as we can practice lifting heavier weights to grow bigger muscles over time.
    - we can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in our mind.
