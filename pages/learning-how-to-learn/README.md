# How to Become a More Effective Learner

Inspired by Learning How to Learn, a Coursera course taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, Offered By McMaster University and University of California San Diego

## focused mode and diffuse mode

the two types of networks that the brain switches wetween

### focused mode

- highly attentive states
- our neural pathways link areas of brain related to what we thinking about
- relates to intense concentration on specific problem or concept
- use focused mode to learn concepts, basic, foundmental knowledge

### diffuse mode

- is a more relaxed resting state
- where our neural pathways randomly link areas of our brain
- often involves a big-picture
- after hard focused work, relax do things that allow diffuse mode to take over
- diffuse mode often generate new ideas, being creative, understand things at the concept level

#### benefit from both focused and diffuse modes, to learn effective and being creative.

## working and Long-term memory

### working memory
    
- immediately and consciously processing in our mind
- it is believed that working memory holds only about 4 chunks of information
- is like a computer Random Access Memory, relatively small in capacity and short term to store information

### long term memory

- is like a storage or a computer harddisk, relatively big capacity and can store information longer time
- important for bigger goal learning, because we need to store fundamental knowledge to go further
- it takes time to move information from working memory to long term memory
- spaced repetition (spacing repetition out over a number of days) is a good way to move working memory to long term memory
- but long term memory needs to be revisited occasionally to keep the memories accessible

### create a lively visual metaphor, analogy, or story 

- to help remember and understand concepts.
- to see something in your mind's eye.
- it is helpful not only in art and literature, but also allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.
- avoid being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.

## sleep

Studies shown that sleep is a vital part of memory and learning

### During sleep, our brain: 

- erase trivial memories 
- strengthen areas of importantce
- rehearses some tougher parts we trying to learn
- going over and over neural patterns to deppen and strengthen them

#### Strength our ability to: 

- figure out difficult problems
- find meaning and understanding in what we are learning

### Learing, try to understand or solve problem right before a nap or sleep

- increase the chance of dreaming about it
- enhace our ability to understand it

#### make a next day plan before sleep



## Chunk

#### Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning

#### When we chunk an idea or concept, we do not need to remember all underlying details.

It's like riding a bike, we only need the main idea biking, all the underlying complex biking activites take place with that simple chunk of thought.

#### One of the first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create conceptual chunks.

### Chunking (how to form chunks)

#### Focus our attention on the information we want to chunk.

#### Understand the basic idea we trying to chunk

- understanding helps hold the underlying memory traces together
- a chunk without understand, is a useless chunk that won't fit in with other material we are learning

#### Gain context, seeing how and when to use the chunk

- Going beyond the initial problem, seeing more broadly.
- Repeat and practice with both related and unrelated problems.
- Knowing when to use and when not use the chunk.
- Fit the chunk into the bigger picture.

#### It's like a tool, if we understand it, know how and when to use (not use), have big picture of the tool, we can benefit most of that it.

## Avoid illusions of competence

#### When we repeatedly read notes or textbook 

- when we draw lines under important centences, or mark them with colors, 
- but with relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practice.

#### When we have the book (or Google) open right in front of us

- it provides the illusion that the material is also in our brain, **but it's not**.

## The importance of recall

#### Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make study time more focused and effective.

#### Do not wait too long to practice recall, we do not want to start from scratch every time.

## consistent

The great wall of China was not build in one day.

#### Divide 

our learning or goal to small doses, and do a little every day.

- Give focused and diffuse modes the time to understand what we are learning.
- As we repeat we active our long term memory.

#### Learning is like gaining muscles

it wouldn't happen overnight, we train, eat, sleep, and muscles grow bigger over time.

#### Fit our level

same as workout, lift too heavy may physically hurt us, right technique, lift weight that we can handle.

#### It's important to have positive feedback to gain motivation to continue.

#### Deliberate practice 

on the toughest aspects of the material. 

- Can help lift average brains into the realm of those with natural gifts.
- Similar to lift heavier weights, which lead our muscles to grow bigger and quicker.
- We can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in our mind.

####  By deliberate practice we can also gain better results.  

##  Physical exercise

- We once fault thought that all of the neurons in the brain won't grow as adults.
- But we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day.
- One of these places is very important for learning new things.

#### New neurons help us learn new things

*but they will die if we do not use them*. 

- New experiences will rescue them.

#### Physical exercises 

also **help the nervous to survive**.

- Exercise is by far better than any drugs on the markets.
- Exercise benefits all of our other organisms.
- It's a good way of interleaving our learning or problem solving,
- give our brain time to practice diffuse thinking.
