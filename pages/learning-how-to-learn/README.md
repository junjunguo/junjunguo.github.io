# How to Become a More Effective Learner

Inspired by Learning How to Learn, a Coursera course taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, Offered By McMaster University and University of California San Diego

## focused mode and diffuse mode

the two types of networks that the brain switches wetween

- focused mode
    - highly attentive states
    - our neural pathways link areas of brain related to what we thinking about
    - relates to intense concentration on specific problem or concept
    - use focused mode to learn concepts, basic, foundmental knowledge

- diffuse mode
    - is a more relaxed resting state
    - where our neural pathways randomly link areas of our brain
    - often involves a big-picture
    - after hard focused work, relax do things that allow diffuse mode to take over
    - diffuse mode often generate new ideas, being creative, understand things at the concept level

benefit from both focused and diffuse modes, to learn effective and being creative.

## working and Long-term memory

- working memory
    - immediately and consciously processing in our mind
    - it is believed that working memory holds only about 4 chunks of information
    - is like a computer Random Access Memory, relatively small in capacity and short term to store information
- long term memory
    - is like a storage or a computer harddisk, relatively big capacity and can store information longer time
    - important for bigger goal learning, because we need to store fundamental knowledge to go further
    - it takes time to move information from working memory to long term memory
    - spaced repetition (spacing repetition out over a number of days) is a good way to move working memory to long term memory
    - but long term memory needs to be revisited occasionally to keep the memories accessible
- create a lively visual metaphor, analogy, or story 
    - to help remember and understand concepts.
    - to see something in your mind's eye.
    - it is helpful not only in art and literature, but also allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.
    - avoid being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.

## sleep

- Studies shown that sleep is a vital part of memory and learning
- During sleep, our brain: 
    - erase trivial memories 
    - strengthen areas of importantce
    - rehearses some tougher parts we trying to learn
    - going over and over neural patterns to deppen and strengthen them
- strength our ability to 
    - figure out difficult problems
    - find meaning and understanding in what we are learning
- learing, try to understand or solve problem right before a nap or sleep
    - increase the chance of dreaming about it
    - enhace our ability to understand it

- recover
- solving problems while sleeping
- make a next day plan before sleep

## chunk

- chunk
    - chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning
    - when we chunk an idea or concept, we do not need to remember all underlying details
    - it's like riding a bike, we only need the main idea biking, all the underlying complex biking activites take place with that simple chunk of thought
    - one of the first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create conceptual chunks
- chunking (how to form a chunk)
    1. focus our attention on the information we want to chunk
    2. understand the basic idea we trying to chunk
        - understanding helps hold the underlying memory traces together
        - a chunk without understand, is a useless chunk that won't fit in with other material we are learning
    3. gain context, not only see how, but also when to use this chunk
        - going beyond the initial problem, seeing more broadly
        - repeat and practice with both related and unrelated problem
        - knowing when to use and not use this chunk
        - fit the chunk into the bigger picture
        - it is like a tool, if we understand the tool, know how to use, when to use, or not use, have big picture of the tool, we can benefit most of that tool

## Avoid illusions of competence

- when we repeatedly read notes or textbook, 
- when we draw lines under important centences, or mark them with colors, 
- but with relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practice.
- when we have the book (or Google) open right in front of us,
- it provides the illusion that the material is also in our brain, but it's not.

## the importance of recall

- using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make study time more focused and effective.
- do not wait too long to practice recall, we do not want to start from scratch every time.

## consistent, the great wall of China was not build in one day

- divide our learning or goal to small doses, and do a little every day
    - give focused and diffuse modes the time to understand what we are learning
    - as we repeat we active our long term memory
- learning is like gaining muscles, it would not happen overnight, we train, eat, sleep, and muscles grow bigger over time.
- fit our level, same as workout, lift too heavy may physically hurt us, right technique, lift weight that we can handle.
- it is important to have positive feedback to gain motivation to continue.
- deliberate practice 
    - on the toughest aspects of the material 
    - can help lift average brains into the realm of those with natural gifts.
    - as we can lift heavier weights to challenge ourselves can lead our muscles to grow bigger and quicker.
    - we can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in our mind.
    - by deliberate practice we can also gain better results.  


##  physical exercise

- We once fault thought that all of the neurons in the brain won't grow as adults.
- but we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day, 
- one of these places is very important for learning new things.
- new neurons help us learn new things, but they will die if we do not use them. 
- new experiences will rescue them.
- physical exercises also help the nervous to survive.
- exercise is by far better than any drugs on the markets.
- exercise benefits all of our other organisms.
- is a good way of interleaving our learning or problem solving
- give our brain time to practice diffuse thinking
