# How to Become a More Effective Learner

Inspired by Learning How to Learn, a Coursera course taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, Offered By McMaster University and University of California San Diego

## focused mode and diffuse mode

the two types of networks that the brain switches wetween

- focused mode
    - highly attentive states
    - our neural pathways link areas of brain related to what we thinking about
    - relates to intense concentration on specific problem or concept
    - use focused mode to learn concepts, basic, foundmental knowledge

- diffuse mode
    - more relaxed resting states,
    - our neural pathways randomly link areas of brain
    - often involves a big-picture
    - after hard focused work, relax do things that allow diffuse mode to take over

    - generate new ideas
    - being creative
    - understand at concept level

to learn effective and be creative, we need both focused and diffuse modes.

## chunk

- chunk
    - things we learned saved as chunk
- chunking
    - connect chunks
    - smaller chunk when we understand
    - connect chunks differently to solve problem, create new understanding, or ideas

## working and Long-term memory

- working memory
    - immediately and consciously processing in our mind
    - it is believed that working memory holds only about 4 chunks of information
    - is like a computer Random Access Memory, relatively small in capacity and short term to store information

    - short term
    - easy to lose
- long term memory
    - is like a storage or a computer harddisk, relatively big capacity and can store information longer time
    - important for bigger goal learning, because we need to store fundamental knowledge to go further
    - it takes time to move information from working memory to long term memory
    - spaced repetition (spacing repetition out over a number of days) can help

    - need to repeat
    - gone if not use


## sleep

- Studies shown that sleep is a vital part of memory and learning
- During sleep, our brain: 
    - erase trivial memories 
    - strengthen areas of importantce
    - rehearses some tougher parts we trying to learn
    - going over and over neural patterns to deppen and strengthen them
- strength our ability to 
    - figure out difficult problems
    - find meaning and understanding in what we are learning
- learing, try to understand or solve problem right before a nap or sleep
    - increase the chance of dreaming about it
    - enhace our ability to understand it

- recover
- solving problems while sleeping
- make a next day plan before sleep
- try to solve problems or try to learn difficult things before sleep

## consistent

- divide our learning or goal to small doses, and do a little every day
    - give focused and diffuse modes the time to understand what er are learning
    - as we repeat we active our long term memory
    
- learning is the same as gaining muscle, it would not happen overnight, we train, eat, sleep, and muscle grow bigger over time.
- fit our level
- same as workout, lift too heavy may physically hurt us, right technique, lift weight that we can handle.
- it is important to have positive feedback to gain motivation to continue.
- Lifting a little heavier to challenge ourselves can lead our muscles to grow bigger and quicker.
- by deliberate practice we can also gain better results.  

## focus time

- 25 minutes concentration time
- music can help concentrate
- little rewards after each focused work: social media, tv, te, chocolate ...

## training 

- grow our brain
- health for our body
- a good way of interleaving your learning or problem solving
- get a diffuse thinking
- get out of something (study, problem need to solve) that may block you


tips: 

#  physical exercise

- We once fault thought that all of the neurons in the brain won't grow as adults.
- but we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day, 
- one of these places is very important for learning new things.
- new neurons help us learn new things, but they will die if we do not use them. 
- new experiences will rescue them.
- physical exercises also help the nervous to survive.
- exercise is by far better than any drugs on the markets.
- exercise benefits all of our other organisms.

tips: 

- create a lively visual metaphor or analogy 
    - to remember and understand concepts.
    - to see something in your mind's eye.
    - helpful in not only in art and literature
    - but also allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.
    - help being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.

- practice
    - deliberate practice 
    - on the toughest aspects of the material 
    - can help lift average brains into the realm of those with natural gifts.
    - as we can practice lifting heavier weights to grow bigger muscles over time.
    - we can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in our mind.
