# How to Become a More Effective Learner

Inspired by Learning How to Learn, a Coursera course taught by Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski, Offered By McMaster University and University of California San Diego

## Focused mode and diffuse mode

‚ú®

The two types of networks that the brain switches wetween.

### Focused mode

ü§î

- Highly attentive states.
- Our neural pathways link brain areas, related to what we thinking.
- Relates to intense concentration on specific problem or concept.

Use focused mode to learn concepts, basic, foundmental knowledge.

### Diffuse mode

üí°

- Is a more relaxed, resting state.
- Where our neural pathways randomly link brain areas.
- Often involves a big-picture.
- After hard focused work, relax, and do things that allow diffuse mode to take over.

Diffuse mode often help us generate new ideas, being creative, understand things at concept level.

#### Benefit from both focused and diffuse modes,

to learn more effectively, and being creative.

## Working and Long term memory

üß†

### Working memory
    
Immediately and consciously processing in our mind.

- It is believed that working memory holds only about 4 chunks of information.
- Like a computer Random Access Memory, relatively small in capacity and store information temporarily.

### Long term memory

- Like a storage or a computer harddisk, relatively big capacity and can store information much longer time.
- Important for bigger goal learning, because we need to store fundamental knowledge to go further.
- Move information from working memory to long term memory takes time.

Spaced repetition (spacing repetition out over a number of days) is a good way to move working memory to long term memory.

Long term memory needs to be revisited occasionally to keep the memories accessible.

### Create lively visual metaphors, analogies, or stories

‚òØÔ∏è

- To help remember and understand concepts.
- To see something in your mind's eye.
- Helpful not only in art and literature, but also allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.
- Also help to avoid being blocked by thinking about problems in wrong ways.

## Sleep

üí§

Studies have shown that sleep is a vital part of memory and learning.

### During sleep, our brain: 

- Erase trivial memories. 
- Strengthen areas of importantce.
- Rehearses some tougher parts we trying to learn.
- Going over and over neural patterns to deppen and strengthen them.

#### Strength our ability to: 

- Figure out difficult problems.
- Find meaning and understanding in what we are learning.

### Learing, try to understand or solve problems right before a nap or sleep

- Increase the chance of dreaming about it.
- Enhace our ability to understand it.

#### Make a next day plan before sleep



## Chunk

üíé

#### Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning

#### When we chunk an idea or concept, we do not need to remember all underlying details.

It's like riding a bike, we only need the main idea biking, all the underlying complex biking activites take place with that simple chunk of thought.

#### One of the first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create conceptual chunks.

### Chunking (how to form chunks)

#### Focus our attention on the information we want to chunk.

#### Understand the basic idea we trying to chunk

- Understanding helps hold the underlying memory traces together.
- A chunk without understand, is a useless chunk that won't fit in with other material we are learning.

#### Gain context, seeing how and when to use the chunk

- Going beyond the initial problem, seeing more broadly.
- Repeat and practice with both related and unrelated problems.
- Knowing when to use and when not use the chunk.
- Fit the chunk into the bigger picture.

#### It's like a tool, if we understand it, know how and when to use (not use), have big picture of the tool, we can benefit most of that it.

## Avoid illusions of competence

üéà

#### When we repeatedly read notes or textbook 

- When we draw lines under important centences, or mark them with colors.
- But with relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practice.

#### When we have the book (or Google) open right in front of us

- It provides the illusion that the material is also in our brain, **but it's not.**

## The importance of recall

üéÅ

#### Using recall, mental retrieval of the key ideas, rather than passive rereading, will make study time more focused and effective.

#### Do not wait too long to practice recall, we do not want to start from scratch every time.

## Consistent

üíß

The great wall of China was not build in one day.

#### Divide 

Our learning or goal to small doses, and do a little every day.

- Give focused and diffuse modes the time to understand what we are learning.
- As we repeat we active our long term memory.

#### Learning is like gaining muscles

üí™

It wouldn't happen overnight, we train, eat, sleep, and muscles grow bigger over time.

#### Fit our level

üèãÔ∏è

Same as workout, lift too heavy may physically hurt us, right technique, lift weight that we can handle.

#### It's important to have positive feedback to gain motivation to continue.

#### Deliberate practice 

on the toughest aspects of the material. 

- Can help lift average brains into the realm of those with natural gifts.
- Similar to lift heavier weights, which lead our muscles to grow bigger and quicker.
- We can also practice certain mental patterns that deepen and enlarge in our mind.

####  By deliberate practice we can also gain better results.  

##  Physical exercise

ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- We once fault thought that all of the neurons in the brain won't grow as adults.
- But we now know that in a few places, new neurons are born every day.
- One of these places is very important for learning new things.

#### New neurons help us learn new things

*but they will die if we do not use them.* 

- New experiences will rescue them.

#### Physical exercises 

also **help the nervous to survive.**

üå±

- Exercise is by far better than any drugs on the markets.
- Exercise benefits all of our other organisms.
- It's a good way of interleaving our learning or problem solving.
- Give our brain time to practice diffuse thinking.
