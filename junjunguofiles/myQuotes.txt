If you don't get what you want, you suffer		 if you get what you don't want, you suffer		 even when you get exactly what you want, you still suffer because you can't hold on to it forever. Your mind is your predicament. It wants to be free of change. Free of pain, free of the obligations of life and death. But change is law and no amount of pretending will alter that reality.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>	Socrates

The so-called "paradox of freedom" is the argument that freedom in the sense of absence of any constraining control must lead to very great restraint, since it makes the bully free to enslave the meek. The idea is, in a slightly different form, and with very different tendency, clearly expressed in [author:Plato|879].<br/><br/>Less well known is the <i>paradox of tolerance</i>: <b>Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them</b>. â€” In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies		 as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the <i>right</i> to suppress them if necessary even by force	 for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument		 they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. <b>We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal</b>.	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>	Karl Raimund Popper
